    <p>Pentagram is the mathematical society of BMSCE, founded in 2013, where individuals with a shared passion for
    mathematics come together. The society was established with the aim of inculcating and promoting advanced mathematical
    concepts among students while providing a common platform for them to share their knowledge. Pentagram encourages 
    participation both inside and outside the curriculum, engaging students to deepen their understanding of mathematics 
    in a collaborative environment.</p>

    <p>The society primarily organizes inter-collegiate competitions and events to foster a love for numbers and analytical thinking.
    It promotes intellectual curiosity and creativity while nurturing a deep appreciation for the beauty and elegance of 
    mathematical concepts and theories. The Pentagram community stands as a vibrant and dynamic group, enhancing students'
    mathematical skills and expanding their perspectives through problem-solving and theoretical discussions.</p>
